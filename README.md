# 3D-SLAM

Implementation of conventional SLAM algorithms for 3D applications. As of now, the extended and unscented Kalman filter has been implemented in Python for simultaneous localization and mapping in 3 dimensions

<!-- ## Files

* **GH_quad_main:** Contains variables to choose a control technique, setup simulation scenarios & controller parameters and run the simulation. See comments for instructions on how to edit the file.
* **default_quad_params:** Contains values for properties related to the Quadrotor and simulation (Quadrotor mass, simulation timestep etc.)
* **GH_Quadcopter:** Module containing the *Quadcopter* class. Parameters and control techniques have been implemented as attributes and methods of this class respectively
* **Indirect_TrajOpt_Quat:** Module containing the *iLQR* class for trajectory optimization. 

## Available Options

### Simulation Scenarios:

Apart from varying parameters such as simulation time via *default_quad_params.py*, it is possible to enforce actuator limits and add obstacles to be avoided (rendered as a sphere). Actuator limits are added as a 'clipping factor', where the limit of each control input is set as weight of the quadrotor times this factor.

### Control Techniques:

The following control and planning techniques are currently available:

* **PID:** This is implemented as a Cascade loop for position and attitude control. The controller gains can be added manually or the *PID_AutoTune* method can be used to find the gains. However, depending on the quadrotor characteristics, the function may take a significant amount of time to execute as it is based on manual tuning heuristics. 

* **LQR:** LQR has been implemented based on modifications for quaternions mentioned in [[1]](#1).

* **MPC:** Convex MPC is available but may not actually reach intermediate points if specified at present
 
* **iLQR:** Trajectory generation for control constraints and obstacle avoidance has been implemented by wrapping the iLQR algorithm inside an Augmented Lagrangian method based on [[2,3]](#2)


A **CBF (Control Barrier Function)** setting for obstacle avoidance is also available which can switched on if desired when setting up the simulation.

## Planned updates/To-dos

* MPC updates (reason about obstacles, handle waypoints better)
* Add options for simulating with disturbances such as wind and noisy estimates (which will requires estimation techniques) 
* Direct Trajectory optimization such as Collocation
* Improve PID autotuning 
* Update requirements.txt -->
